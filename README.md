# Moodle Captcha Solver

![img](ghimg/moodle_meme.png)

This is a small chrome extension to autosolve the moodle captchas. To use it, 
clone the repository and change the `matches` attribute in `manifest.json` to 
your insititute moodle URL (my insti is the default). Then, load an unpacked 
extension

If you're from my institute, check out the Builds section for a prebuilt 
package that you can load into chrome
